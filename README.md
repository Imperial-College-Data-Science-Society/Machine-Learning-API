# Machine Learning API
> ICDSS Machine Learning Workshop Series: Machine Learning API

- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [Overview](#overview)
- [License](#license)

## Getting Started

### macOS

1. `source scripts/setup.sh`



## Prerequisites

* Linear Models
* Scientific Python (NumPy & SciPy)
* Neural Networks

## Overview

In this workshop we will cover the most frequently used High-Level Machine Learning libraries,
[`scikit-learn`](http://scikit-learn.org/) and [`keras`](https://keras.io/).
The focus of this workshop will be on how to the implementation of abstract models in code,
using the universal `fit`-`predict`-`score` pattern most machine learning APIs follow.
Multiple sandbox projects will be attempted, including multivariate regression, classification and time-series forecasting.
